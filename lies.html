    <p>Common matrix lies: "Andrew tate fans are spreading fake news about his innocence", <br> "Andrew Tate, misogonist raped someone", <br> "
        Andrew Tate, a f**k up and misogynist, accosted Greta Thunberg on Twitter and showed off his car collection and their emissions. A brief but specific exchange ensued, in which Greta murdered Tate with her words.", <br> 
        Bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up bitch.” These are the words of Andrew Tate, the online influencer arrested in Romania on charges of organised crime, human trafficking and rape. Unlike others accused of similar crimes, Tate boasts an adoring fan base of millions online, many of them young men. As his views (including that women are men’s property, and that rape victims should “bear responsibility” for their attacks) gain traction, schools and parents are asking how to tackle his popularity with boys.
